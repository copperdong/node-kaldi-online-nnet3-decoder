# node-kaldi-online-nnet3-decoder

Be aware that the decoder is designed for Kaldi "Grammar FST with on the fly parts"
https://kaldi-asr.org/doc/grammar.html

This module was put together for one of my side project. I'm not a C++ dev so it might not be perfectly functional.

Pull requests are welcome :)

## Requirements

A compiled version of Kaldi in `/opt/kaldi`.

## Dependencies

`apt install apt install libatlas-dev libatlas-base-dev libfst-dev`
